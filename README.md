Open Source Inventory Management System is a desktop based IMS application written in C# using Bunifu framework. It uses MSSQL as the data back end and has a Winform based user interface.
You can use it easily. Some screens I haven't developed yet, but in my spare time I'm trying to make improvements and make them fully suitable. 
Open to contributions.
